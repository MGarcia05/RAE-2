            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                My Son, Christopher Raekwon Martin (Rae); a handsome 24-year-old with an affectionate smile that could brighten the whole room. Rae was a wonderful blessing from God who was loved by everyone he met. 
                He was truly a family man that enjoyed hanging out with his family and close friends. His laughter, warmth, and humble spirit was loved by all. 
                He was known for his singing, dancing, and playing his PlayStation.<br>
                <br>
                On November 24, 2019 I lost my dancing songbird with the humble spirit. Losing Rae was the hardest experiences I’ve had to live through. 
                Moving on from an experience like this seemed impossible. I questioned God so many times.  
                Lord, what am I supposed to do to get out of this situation?<br>
                <br>
                Then one night in April 2020 I made a request of God to show me my purpose and plan for my life going forward. 
                When I woke up the next morning, I had a heavy feeling on my heart; a feeling of wanting to help others. I knew that I had to “save these babies”. 
                This was a feeling that I could not get rid of; I know that God was leading me in a direction that would have a great impact on so many.<br>
                <br>
                On June 2, 2021 this adversity gave me the opportunity to begin the birth of Rae of Hope Ministry. I am on a mission to save lives and bring hope to those affected by depression and suicide. 
                My focus is on building communities working together for the greater good. Rae left us with wonderful memories and his love for us will help guide us through this Rae of Hope journey. 
                Rae brought a light so great to those that knew him that even now his light remains. He is our Rae of Hope.<br>
