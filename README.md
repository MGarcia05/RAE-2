# RAE-2
 Second draft for Rae of Hope Website

Moved from a scrolling-type website to a static website, including a navigation bar to the side to access each page. Added landing "Welcome" page. 

In an effort to keep practicing my skills, used HTML, CSS, and JS instead of relying on Bootstrap. Focused on mobile-first approach (which I did not do on the last one, unfortunately). Continued with Sass(SCSS) to keep it customizable.
